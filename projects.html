                <h3>System Analysis and Redesign</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Executed a gap analysis project on the MIS department student internship acquisition system resulting in a recommendation for a new information system to support and match students with employers</li>
                    <li>Consulted with Board members from Google and Handshake to conduct in-depth analysis of their business needs and requirements for the proposed system</li>
                    <li>Applied project management tools such as Gantt charts, conducted problem analysis of the current system, as well as requirements gathering and analysis for the proposed system</li>
                    <li>Ran risk analysis on the project with economic impact to calculate a ROI of 223% and a payback periodof 6 months for the project</li>
                    <li>Presented findings and recommendations to Board members and stakeholders, resulting in the implementation of the proposed system</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Database Management System and Analytical Dashboard</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilized SQL to create, populate, and manipulate tables in an Oracle database. Wrote statements to create
                        necessary tables for storing employee, customer, and order data</li>
                    <li>Applied advanced SQL queries, to retrieve and analyze data from multiple tables in the database. These
                        queries were used to generate reports on metrics such as sales, inventory, and customer behavior</li>
                    <li>Developed a Python script using Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly connected to the Datapane framework,
                        creating an analytical dashboard that can extract, clean, and present the data in a clear and concise format</li>
                    <li>Implemented interactive features, allowing users to easily navigate and filter the data to obtain specific
                        insights on their operations using visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and histograms</li>
                </ul>
